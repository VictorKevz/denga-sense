- summary: for the first object ("Todayâ€™s Weather Overview"), provide a concise summary of at least 3 sentences. For all other objects, provide a one-sentence natural-language summary of the card based on the weather data
- features: an array of 3 concise bullet points (8-12 words each) giving additional insights, tips, or related details specific to the weather data.
- subTitle: a 1 or 2-word title that matches the features in the array of each object, for example "Games" for the "Fun Vibes" object
Only change the summary, subTitle and features based on the data. Titles and ids must remain fixed. Return only the JSON array.`;
